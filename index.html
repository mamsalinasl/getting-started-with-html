    <B>Introduction to Programming Notes</B>
  </P>
  <br>
  <p>Hi guys! Here are my notes for the first lesson. I hope they're useful. I tend to take notes in outline form and rely on abbreviations and such. I think I wrote most things out into sentences, but if you're not sure about something or have any feedback,
    please let me know!
    <br>Thanks!
    <br>

  <P><b>Introduction</b></P>
  <p> Think Like a Programmer by using:
    <br>
    <br> 1. <u><b>Procedural Thinking</b></u> to tell the computer what to do using clear instructions.
    <br> 2. <u><b>Abstract Thinking</b></u> to find similarities amongst different things.
    <br> 3. <u><b>Systems Thinking</b></u> to help break down a big problem into smaller pieces.
    <br> 4. <u><b>Technological Empathy</b></u> which means to see eye to eye with the computer; see how it sees things and both its advantages and limitations.
    <br> 5. <u><b>Debugging</b></u> to figure out what is failing, why it’s failing, and how to fix it.</p>

  <p>We'll be learning about:
    <br> 1) Basics of the world-wide web
    <br> 2) HTML Documents
    <br> 3) URLs
    <br> 4) HTTP
    <br> 5) Web Applications
    <br>
  </p>
  <p><b>Unit I: The Basics of the Web</b></p>
  <p>You & Your Computer (+Browser) --> The Internet --> HTTP --> Servers
    <br>
    <br>
    <b><u>Vocabulary:</u></b>
    <br>
    <b>• HTTP:</u></b> the main protocol of the web
    <br>
    <b>• Servers:</b> computers that host the files that make up the web
    <br>
    <b>• Internet:</b> the world’s largest computer network
    <br>
    <b>• Browser:</b> a program that runs on your computer to display files found on the web
    <br>
  </p>
  <p><b>The World Wide Web</b>
    <br> The world-wide web (www) is a collection of HTML documents.
    <br> Hyperlinks connect the sites together via URLs (links)
    <br> Anything can exist on the web.
    <br>
  </p>
  <p><b>HTML</b> - HyperText Markup Language
    <br> The basis of most websites. It's a language used to give computers commands as to how we want websites to act and look like. It's made up of what we see, markup (what it looks like), links or references to other things (e.g. videos, images).</p>
  <b>HTML Markup</b>
  <br> I added extra spaces so the different tags could be displayed here and not be read as commands by the computer. Sorry if it makes it hard to understand!
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>< n a m e ></b> contents <b>< / n a m e ></b>
  <br> Tags:
  <br>
  <b>bold</b>
  < b>
    < /b>
      <br>
      <em>italic</em>
      < em>
        < /em>
          <br>
          <u>underline</u>
          < u>
            < /u>
              </p>
              <br>
              <p><b>HTML Attributes</b>
                <br>
                <b>< Tag attr = "value" ></b> content <b>< / Tag></b>
                <br>
                <b>< a ></b> anchor tag
                <br>
                <b>< a href = "www.google.com" > </b>text goes here <b>< / a> </b>
                <br>
                <b>< img src = "url" alt = "text" > </b>VOID TAG (no content so don't need closing tag)
                <br>
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
                <b>White Space</b>
                <br> All white space in your working space turns into a single space.
                <br>
                <b>< br ></b> - break (void); inline (ending in a line)
                <br>
                <b>< p > < / p ></b> - paragraph; has content inside. Makes an invible box (a block). A paragraph can be stylized.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Inline Elements:</b>
                < a>,
                  < br>,
                    < em>, img, strong, span
                      <br> The inline elements stay along the line and just work to modify along it. The block elements have an imaginary box workspace that can be edited.
              </p>
              <p><b>Span/Div:</b>
                <br> Contain their content.
                <br>
                <b>Span</b> is inline; CSS
                <br>
                <b>< span class = "foo" ></b>
                <br> text
                <br>
                <b>< / span > </b>
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Div</b> - block that acts a bit like a paragraph
                <br>
                <b>< div class = "bar" > </b>
                <br> text
                <br>
                <b> < / div ></b>
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
                <b>HTML Documents:</b>
                <br> There are different kinds of HTML documents. Here we're using HTML5:
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>< ! DOCTYPE HTML > </b> - doctype is the type of HTML (currently HTML5)
                <br>
                <b> < html > </b>HTML type
                <br> First comes the head.
                <br><b>< head > </b> Metadata goes here. This includes JS and CSS
                <br>
                <b>< / head> </b>
                <br> After the head comes the body. This is the actual visible content of the site.
                <br>
                <b> < body > </b>
                <br> Content goes here!
                <br>
                <b>< /body ></b>
                <br>
                <b>< / html></b>
              </p>
              <p><b>Review:</b>
                <br>
                <u>Note:</u> once I learn how to indent this will look a lot better and easier to understand.
                <br>
                <br> HTML documents:
                <br> [———html———]
                <br>
                < head>
                  <br> [title CSS JS]
                  <br>
                  < / head>
                    <br>
                    < body>
                      <br> [contents]
                      <br>
